# Experiments in a Grid Network

These folders in this page are built to provide readers with access to the input data, code and some key results related to the experiments conducted across a grid network. For more detailed description about the setting of these experiments, please refer to the paper named predicting the matching probability and ride/shared distance for each dynamic ridepooling order: A mathematical modeling approach. As indicated by the names of these folders, the input data, code and results are organized in different folders with name `input`, `program` and `output`, respectively. For the purpose of clear exposition, more words attached to each floder are put inside it.

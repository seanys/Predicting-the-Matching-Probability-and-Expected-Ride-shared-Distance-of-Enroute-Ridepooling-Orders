# Some Key Results

Constrained by the limited storage space, only key results are performed here. 

Convergent_result: this file makes a display of the information about the convergency for each scenario.

Rmse_mape: this file shows the RMSE and MAPE of the matching probability, ride/shared distance for each OD pair

Rmse_mape_normal_distribution: this file also shows the RMSE and MAPE of the matching probability, ride/shared distance for each OD pair. But this is for the variant version with the waiting time following normal distribution instead of a constant for each OD pair.

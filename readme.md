## Predicting the Matching Probability and Expected Ride/shared Distance of Enroute Ridepooling Orders

`prediction.py` : Predict the matching probability and expected ride/shared distance based on the demand rate `network/combined_0.csv` and network `network/all_edges.csv` `network/all_vertexes.csv`. The progam will download the matching relationship at first.

`simulation.py` : Simulate the carpooling system based on the order provided by DIDI Chuxing. 

`statistic.py` : Analyse the simulation results and compare with the prediction results. 

`grid-experiments/`: The experiments in 30x30 grid network.
